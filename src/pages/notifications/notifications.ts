This place beats most of the sit-down Filipino Restaurant I know with regards to execution of traditional Filipino dishes, including or maybe tied with L.A. Rose.  Give them a try! I really like their beer selection and Seafood Boil options.Had the Mussel Boil and did not skimp on the seasonings or ingredients.Very full of flavor. They have good A/ C.',

Today ordered the pork sinigang soup (tamarind) and the Fried bangus (Fried milkfish in vinegar, garlic, and pepper), and a couple scoops of garlic rice. The server suggested for next time, the pancit bihon(rice noodles saut√©ed with veggies and a meat) and the beef steak Tagalog(sirloin strips with onions, lemon, pepper, soy sauce and fried onion rings).',

The area can be deceiving because of not being new but inside is pleasant, cool and presentable. The staff was attentive and helpful and the best part is the food, it was definitely excellent authentic filipino cuisine. Don"t miss out on the cebuchon(pork belly).I myself make my own and their version did not disappoint, flavorful and crunchy pork skin.Thank you, Jun, Ms.V and the staff, you helped made the day memorable.',
